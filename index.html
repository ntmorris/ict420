        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>This is a website about the life and accomplishments of Julius Caesar.</p>
        <p>In 49 BC, Caesar had recently ended his term as governor of <b>Gaul</b><sup>1</sup> and ignited a civil war. It was illegal to bring armies into the Italian peninsula. The cards were stacked against him and he was accused of treason. Having popular support anyway, he marched accross the <b>Rubicon River</b><sup>2</sup> -- entering the peninsula -- with an army. Upon doing so, he said quoting <b>Menander</b><sup>3</sup>: <q><i>Alea iacta est</i></q> ("The die is cast.") This action started a civil war against <b>Pompey</b>'s<sup>4</sup> faction of the Roman government.</p>
