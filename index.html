        <p>Caesar was born on July 12th, 100 BC. There isn't much written of his childhood. In 85 BC, his father died
        unexpectedly. Thus, a young teenaged Caesar became the head of the family. At this time, a civil war had broken out
        between <b>Sulla</b><sup>1</sup> and <b>Marius</b><sup>2</sup>. Which of the two was in power changed repeatedly.
        Not only was Caesar Marius' nephew by marriage, but Caesar was also married to the daughter of Cinna (Marius' ally).
        So, while Caesar was not explicitly part of the war, he had heavy connections to very powerful individuals on one
        side. This happened to be the losing side. Caesar's connections made him a target of Sulla' re-installed regime.
        Many restrictions were placed on Caesar. Though Sulla reluctantly pardoned him, Caesar thought it best to stay
        far away, so he joined the military.</p>
        
        <p>Sulla died in 78 BC. Seeing as Sulla was Caesar's reason for being away, he returned to Rome. However, Caesar
        was left to a modest restart in his life, being that Sulla revoked Caesar's inheritance for his connections to
        Marius' regime. He took to legal advocacy. Once, while travelling the <b>Aegean Sea</b><sup>3</sup>, Caesar was
        kidnapped by pirates. He was unimpressed with their demand of 20 talents of silver for his ransom and implored
        them to demand more. He promised them he would have them crucified once freed. Soon, the ransom was paid. Caesar
        quickly raised a fleet and crucified his former captors.</p>
        
        <p>Not long after, he was called back to military service. Subsequent to his successes, he was elected <b>Military
        Tribune</b><sup>4</sup>. In 69 BC, he was elected <b>Quaestor</b><sup>5</sup>, which he served as in the province
        of Hispania (modern Spain). That same year his aunt and wife both died. Four years later, he was elected <b>Curule
        Aedile</b><sup>6</sup>, then <b>Pontifex Maximus</b><sup>7</sup> in 63 BC. Many accusations were pointed at Caesar
        during this time, from bribery to being a part of the <a href='https://youtu.be/MkZx0q_3rYI?t=467' target="_blank">
        Catilinarian Conspiracy</a><sup>8</sup>.</p>
        
        <p>In trade to <b>Crassus</b><sup>9</sup>, Caesar supported Crassus' efforts against <b>Pompey</b><sup>10</sup> as
        Crassus settled Caesar's debts. Caesar continued his military victories in Hispania, where he was proclaimed
        <b>Imperator</b><sup>11</sup>. He wished for a <b>Triumph</b><sup>12</sup> to be held in his honor, but he was
        required to be in Rome if to stand for the consul election. Appealing to stand for the election in absence, he was
        forced to choose the Triumph or the election in ultimatum, which he chose the latter. Caesar was then elected
        Consul for the year 59 BC.</p>

        <p>This is a website about the life and accomplishments of Julius Caesar.</p>
        <p>In 49 BC, Caesar had recently ended his term as governor of <b>Gaul</b><sup>1</sup> and ignited a civil war. It was
        illegal to bring armies into the Italian peninsula. The cards were stacked against him and he was accused of treason.
        Having popular support anyway, he marched accross the <b>Rubicon River</b><sup>2</sup> -- entering the peninsula --
        with an army. Upon doing so, he said quoting <b>Menander</b><sup>3</sup>: <q><i>Alea iacta est</i></q> ("The die is
        cast.") This action started a civil war against <b>Pompey</b>'s<sup>4</sup> faction of the Roman government.</p>

        <p>One of Caesar's greatest military feats was the Battle of Alesia in 52 BC. It was extremely unorthodox. His
        opponent, Vercingetorix, was holding up in a well defended fort on a hill with reinforcements on the way. Seeing that
        attacking was suicide, and waiting was also suicide, Caesar ordered his men to cut down thousands of trees. They then
        built an inverted fort, one with the walls facing the fort they were sieging. Then, they cut thousands more trees,
        building yet another fort facing the conventional direction. Alesia was thus a fort within an inverted fort within a
        fort. In this battle, a young officer named Mark Antony, would come to the spotlight and become Caesar's right-hand man,
        but later in life become his mortal enemy.</p>
