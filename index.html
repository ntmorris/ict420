            <div>
                <p>Caesar was born on July 12th, 100 BC. There isn't much written of his childhood. In 85 BC, his father died
                unexpectedly. Thus, a young teenaged Caesar became the head of the family. At this time, a civil war had broken out
                between <b>Sulla</b><sup>1</sup> and <b>Marius</b><sup>2</sup>. Which of the two was in power changed repeatedly.
                Not only was Caesar Marius' nephew by marriage, but Caesar was also married to the daughter of Cinna (Marius' ally).
                So, while Caesar was not explicitly part of the war, he had heavy connections to very powerful individuals on one
                side. This happened to be the losing side. Caesar's connections made him a target of Sulla's re-installed regime.
                Many restrictions were placed on Caesar. Though Sulla reluctantly pardoned him, Caesar thought it best to stay
                far away, so he joined the military.</p>
                
                <p>Sulla died in 78 BC. Seeing as Sulla was Caesar's reason for being away, he returned to Rome. However, Caesar
                was left to a modest restart in his life, being that Sulla revoked Caesar's inheritance for his connections to
                Marius' regime. He took to legal advocacy. Once, while travelling the <b>Aegean Sea</b><sup>3</sup>, Caesar was
                kidnapped by pirates. He was unimpressed with their demand of 20 talents of silver for his ransom and implored
                them to demand more. He promised them he would have them crucified once freed. Soon, the ransom was paid. Caesar
                quickly raised a fleet and crucified his former captors.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
            <p>Not long after, he was called back to military service. Subsequent to his successes, he was elected <b>Military
            Tribune</b><sup>4</sup>. In 69 BC, he was elected <b>Quaestor</b><sup>5</sup>, which he served as in the province
            of Hispania (modern Spain). That same year his aunt and wife both died. Four years later, he was elected <b>Curule
            Aedile</b><sup>6</sup>, then <b>Pontifex Maximus</b><sup>7</sup> in 63 BC. Many accusations were pointed at Caesar
            during this time, from bribery to being a part of the <a href='https://youtu.be/MkZx0q_3rYI?t=467' target="_blank">
            Catilinarian Conspiracy</a><sup>8</sup>.</p>
            
            <p>In trade to <b>Crassus</b><sup>9</sup>, Caesar supported Crassus' efforts against <b>Pompey</b><sup>10</sup> as
            Crassus settled Caesar's debts. Caesar continued his military victories in Hispania, where he was proclaimed
            <b>Imperator</b><sup>11</sup>. He wished for a <b>Triumph</b><sup>12</sup> to be held in his honor, but he was
            required to be in Rome if to stand for the consul election. Appealing to stand for the election in absence, he was
            forced to choose the Triumph or the election in ultimatum, which he chose the latter. Caesar was then elected
            Consul for the year 59 BC.</p>
            
        <div class="wrapper2">
            <div>
                <p>During his consulship, he had an informal alliance with two others: Crassus and Pompey. This is known as the
                <b>First Triumvirate</b><sup>13</sup>. They were the three most powerful people in Rome. They reconciled their 
                differences for the sake of power. Caesar proposed redistributing public land to the poor of Rome, even if by
                force. The Triumvirate used force to pass the legislation, putting soldiers in the Roman capital. Caesar secured
                the governership of <b>Gaul</b><sup>14</sup> (then Southern France) for after his consulship.</p>
                
                <p>Gaul was on the frontier of Rome. What is now France was a land of Gallic tribes with uneasy relations. Over
                the next several years, Caesar conquered the rest of modern France little by little. Meanwhile, the First
                Triumvirate broke down. Crassus was killed in battle. Caesar's wife (Pompey's daughter) died in childbirth. Caesar
                offered marriage to his great-niece to Pompey to regain his favor -- as Caesar was still indebted to him. Pompey
                declined. He instead married the daughter of one of Caesar's political opponents. Caesar later went on to achieve
                one of his greatest, and most strategically impressive, victories: Alesia. The victory at which solidified all of
                modern France into the Roman Republic.</p>

            <p>One of Caesar's greatest military feats was the Battle of Alesia in 52 BC. It was extremely unorthodox. His
            opponent, Vercingetorix, was holding up in a well defended fort on a hill with reinforcements on the way. Seeing that
            attacking was suicide, and waiting was also suicide, Caesar ordered his men to cut down thousands of trees. They then
            built an inverted fort, one with the walls facing the fort they were sieging. Then, they cut thousands more trees,
            building yet another fort facing the conventional direction. Alesia was thus a fort within an inverted fort within a
            fort. In this battle, a young officer named <b>Mark Antony</b><sup>15</sup>, would come to the spotlight and become
            Caesar's right-hand man.</p>
  
            <p>The Senate ordered Caesar to return to Rome at the end of his tenure as governor of Gaul. He thought that he might
            be put on trial for his actions as Consul -- because, by Roman law, he was immune to this as governor. He got word
            that Pompey accused him of insubordination and treason. So, in January of 49 BC, Caesar began his journey to Rome. Per
            Roman law, it was illegal for armies to cross the <b>Rubicon River</b><sup>16</sup>. Knowing the accusations, Caesar
            crossed with one legion (several thousand men), saying: "The die is cast". Pompey and the senators fled to the South,
            having little faith in the newly raised troops of Pompey. Pompey escaped to Hispania (Spain). In pursuit, Caesar left
            Mark Antony in charge of Italy. Caesar decisively defeated Pompey in two battles. Pompey then escaped to Egypt.</p>
            
            <p>Caesar was then appointed <b>Dictator</b><sup>17</sup> in Rome and appointed Mark Antony his second-in-command.
            Caesar, as dictator, presided over his election to Consul again, then resigned the Dictatorship. Caesar promptly
            pursued Pompey to Egypt, whereupon he was presented with Pompey's head. He then had Pompey's assassins put to death.
            Egypt was in a civil war at this time. It became known that the pharoah was the one who had Pompey killed. Likely due
            to this, Caesar intervened in the Egyptian civil war against the pharoah, won, and installed the pharoah's sister as
            the new pharoah, Cleopatra, with whom he likely fathered a son, Caesarion. Caesar went on to conquer Pontus, a kingdom
            on the southern coast of the Black Sea. On his way to which, he stopped in Tarsus (a city in modern Turkey). A
            supporter of Pompey had planned to assassinate Caesar there. With this realization, after conquering Pontus, Caesar left
            to Africa, then Spain to defeat the remnants of Pompey's sons supporters. Ending the civil war, Caesar was declared
            Dictator for ten years.</p>
            
            <p>Caesar used his second tenure as Dictator -- now bestowed for 10 years -- to enact many reforms. He passed a new
            constitution, which he used for several of his own goals. Slowly, he solidified more and more power to himself, while
            waning the strength of other institutions, such as the senate. His ambitions grew, and he had a "Forum of Caesar" built
            in Rome. After many, many years, the Roman calendar had misaligned with the seasons. He reformed the calendar, thus
            making the Julian Calendar, a descendant calendar is used today. The month of July is named in Caesar's honor.</p>
            
            <p>On the Ides of March (an important date of the Roman calendar), Caesar warily took his seat at the head of the senate
            floor. One senate approached Caesar to have his brother recalled from exile. Caesar waved him away, but other senators
            were gathering around Caesar at this moment. The senator which initially approached him pulled his tunic down, exposing
            Caesar's chest. The gathering senators produced their daggers, stabbing Caesar a total of 23 times. The state of Rome
            began declining after his assassination. To restore order, the Second Triumvirate was formed. This was made up of:
            Mark Antony, <b>Octavian</b><sup>18</sup> (whom Caesar adopted), and Lepidus. This, too, broke down. A series of civil
            wars were then fought, culminating in Octavian's rise to be the first emperor. He proclaimed himself by his new name:
            Augustus Caesar.</p>
